# Community-Skill-Sharing-Platform

The **Community Skill Sharing Platform** is a web-based system which aims to encourage communities share their knowledge and skills. It allows individuals to teach one another different skills they have mastered besides learning from each other. The ultimate goal of the project then is to facilitate a space where individuals can both teach and learn, the platform aims to enrich community engagement and promote the sharing of diverse talents.

Users can create profiles, list the skills they wish to share, and search for skills they want to acquire. The platform includes features such as direct messaging for seamless communication between users and a rating system to provide feedback on skill sessions. This setup not only helps individuals enhance their skillsets but also strengthens community bonds by encouraging collaborative learning.

This platform is particularly useful for community centers, educational groups, and hobbyist circles looking to create a structured environment for skill exchange. It supports personal growth, community interaction, and the democratization of knowledge by making skill sharing accessible to everyone.
